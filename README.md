# AI_Newbies-Streamlit

## Overview
This repository hosts the code and documentation for the AI_Newbies team participating in the Upstage AI Hackathon, where we have developed a fine-tuned AI model designed to promote Jeju Island tourism. The model is deployed through a Streamlit app, offering interactive conversations that mimic the personalities of tourism ambassadors and provide insights into local attractions.

## Brief Synopsis
The fine-tuned adapters, which tailor the large language model to specific tasks, can be found on [GitHub - AI_Newbies-Upstage-AI-Hackathon](https://github.com/JohnnyRobs19/AI_Newbies-Upstage-AI-Hackathon).The repository includes our approach to training LLM adapters, providing detailed notebooks and resources that outline the methods used to customize the model's responses for promoting Jeju Island tourism. You can explore and download the fine-tuned adapters directly from the repository.
