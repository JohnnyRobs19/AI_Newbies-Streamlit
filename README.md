# AI_Newbies-Streamlit

## Overview
This repository hosts the code and documentation for the AI_Newbies team participating in the Upstage AI Hackathon, where we have developed a fine-tuned AI model designed to promote Jeju Island tourism. The model is deployed through a Streamlit app, offering interactive conversations that mimic the personalities of tourism ambassadors and provide insights into local attractions.

## Brief Synopsis
The fine-tuned adapters, which tailor the large language model to specific tasks, can be found on [GitHub - AI_Newbies-Upstage-AI-Hackathon](https://github.com/JohnnyRobs19/AI_Newbies-Upstage-AI-Hackathon).The repository includes our approach to training LLM adapters, providing detailed notebooks and resources that outline the methods used to customize the model's responses for promoting Jeju Island tourism. You can explore and download the fine-tuned adapters directly from the repository.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project running.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](python.org).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/RextonRZ/AI_Newbies-Streamlit.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```plaintext
cd AI_Newbies-Upstage-AI-Hackathon
```

3. Install dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment. If you do not have venv installed, you can install it using:
```plaintext
pip install virtualenv
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```plaintext
virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   #Windows
#source venv/bin/activate  #Linux and macOS
```

Install the project dependencies:
```plaintext
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Project
1. Start the Streamlit app
```plaintext
streamlit run jejubot.py
```

## Disclaimer
The AI model and fine-tuned adapters presented in this repository are intended for stimulation and educational purposes only. While we have made efforts to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the content, the use of these models in production environments or for critical applications should be approached with caution.
