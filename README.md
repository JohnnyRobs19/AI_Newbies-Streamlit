# AI_Newbies-Streamlit

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the AI_Newbies team participating in the Upstage AI Hackathon. The project involves deploying fine-tuned models using Streamlit, which showcases how tourism ambassadors can leverage AI to promote Jeju Island. The model is designed to allow ambassadors to communicate in a way that reflects their unique personalities and provides insights about local attractions. The Streamlit app serves as the user interface, enabling interactive conversations with the AI to enhance tourism experiences in Jeju.
